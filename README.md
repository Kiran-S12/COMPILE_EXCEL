# COMPILE_EXCEL

## Overview

**COMPILE_EXCEL** is a powerful VBA macro designed to automate the process of combining data from multiple Excel and CSV files into a single worksheet. It supports merging all sheets or a specific sheet across files, handles varied column headers, can skip duplicate rows (optional), and logs errors and issues during the merge process.

## Features

- **Combine Multiple Files:** Merge data from `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.xlsm`, and `.csv` files within a selected folder.
- **Flexible Sheet Selection:** Option to combine all sheets or just a specific sheet name across files.
- **Header Handling:** Dynamically gathers all unique headers and allows custom column order in the output.
- **Duplicate Removal:** Optionally skips duplicate rows based on all columns.
- **Error Logging:** Generates a detailed error log sheet for files/sheets that could not be processed.
- **Safe Naming:** Automatically renames existing output and error log sheets to prevent overwriting.
- **Status Updates:** Application status bar and summary messages keep you informed of progress.

7. **Review Results:**
